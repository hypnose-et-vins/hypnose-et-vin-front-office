    "content1": "Originally from Lyon, I first studied medicine, then molecular biology, keen to unravel the cellular mysteries of human beings. After health concerns that forced me to reconsider my career choices, I studied law and human resources management. I then worked in various professions within SMEs and Key Accounts. However, I quickly realize that this job puts me in conflict with some of my values. In search of a more authentic path and more in keeping with my identity, I naturally turn to alternative medicine, psychology and Ericksonian hypnosis. A lucid and hypersensitive dreamer since childhood, I have long searched for answers in books in order to channel my sensitivity and empathy. However, it was only by encountering hypnosis that I was able to put words into my altered nocturnal state of consciousness. And then there were also my hands, those hands that heal when I put them on a sensitive area of ​​the other's body.",
